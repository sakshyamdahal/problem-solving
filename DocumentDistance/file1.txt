On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point. In his final, selfless act, a Montana father of three rescued his 13-year-old son when he slipped on a rock and fell into the ocean off northern California on Sunday, officials said. But after Steven Bierle jumped into the water and pushed the boy to safety at the remote Black Sands Beach in Shelter Cove, a large wave swept the 44-year-old from the shore, the Humboldt County Coroner's Office said in a statement.

In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that the appearance of your text should have no appeal at all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point. In his final, selfless act, a Montana father of three rescued his 13-year-old son when he slipped on a rock and fell into the ocean off northern California on Sunday, officials said. But after Steven Bierle jumped into the water and pushed the boy to safety at the remote Black Sands Beach in Shelter Cove, a large wave swept the 44-year-old from the shore, the Humboldt County Coroner's Office said in a statement.

In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that the appearance of your text should have no appeal at all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point. In his final, selfless act, a Montana father of three rescued his 13-year-old son when he slipped on a rock and fell into the ocean off northern California on Sunday, officials said. But after Steven Bierle jumped into the water and pushed the boy to safety at the remote Black Sands Beach in Shelter Cove, a large wave swept the 44-year-old from the shore, the Humboldt County Coroner's Office said in a statement.

In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that the appearance of your text should have no appeal at all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly. Matthew Carter’s screen-sympathetic Georgia is a case in point. In his final, selfless act, a Montana father of three rescued his 13-year-old son when he slipped on a rock and fell into the ocean off northern California on Sunday, officials said. But after Steven Bierle jumped into the water and pushed the boy to safety at the remote Black Sands Beach in Shelter Cove, a large wave swept the 44-year-old from the shore, the Humboldt County Coroner's Office said in a statement.

In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that the appearance of your text should have no appeal at all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading. Your choice of font is important, but the kind of “family” you choose is project-specific, and we won’t discuss it here except to make one point: the conventional wisdom among Web designers that only sans-serif fonts are suitable for body text is just a rule of thumb. Although serif fonts, with their greater complexity, may tend to be less effective at small sizes, there are many other factors to consider. A diminutive x-height, for example, could impair the readability of a font from either camp. Some serif fonts are highly legible and attractive for paragraph text if they are set properly.

On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that might distract you from reading.
